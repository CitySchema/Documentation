    <h2 id="models">Guidelines for 3D Model Structure and Level of Detail</h2> 
    <p>
        The architecture of this schema, where we use one Multipatch or .Obj file to represent a building, bridge or wall is well suited to handling mesh objects that represent only the exterior shell of the structure.  It is preferable that the mesh be a closed “solid” that has all of its faces oriented toward to outside.  Within this guideline, there are many possibilities for levels of detail – as listed in the table below.  
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>    Models that are not closed or include two-dimensional planes with single faces are problematic as Multipatches and can behave unpredictably with regard to shading, importing, and exporting.
    <li>    We are unable to publish models that incorporate textures or materials at this time. We may be able to represent these as multipatches, but the textures or materials will have to come off when the models are exported to SketchUp or OBJ.  This is an issue that we hope to address in coming revisions. 
    <li>    Level of detail 3 is preferred.  If models of building shells may be divided when building parts have distinct functions, like parking structures.  Or when parts have different construction dates.
    <li>   Models of LOD 4 or greater require a lot of work to assimilate and may be impossible to clean up to the point of working with our system. 
    </ul>    
    
    
    <h2 id="LOD">3D Model Levels of Detail </h2>
    <p>These levels of detail are compatible with the CityGML LOD scheme but are sub-divided according to the types of rough massing models that we commonly see shared by architects and hobbyists who share models onsites like 3D Warehouse.
