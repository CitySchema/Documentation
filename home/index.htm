    <h2>City Model Stewardship</h2>
    <p>    <p>Before digging into the technical details of <b>How</b> to manage a city-wide collection of 3D models, it will be useful to have a picture of the sorts of people for whom this scheme has been designed, and the personal and institutional <b>motivations</b> that make this effort worthwhile.  
    </p>
    <figure class="middle"> 
      <img class="scaled" src="images/zakim.jpg"> 
      <figcaption>A scene from the Boston city model.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p>
    <h2 id="roles">Roles andMotivations for Owners, Users and Contributors</h2>
    <p>There are many individuals, communities and institutions that are interested in exploring and contributing to a city-wide 3D  model that reflects current street-scapes; and remembers past and proposed future scenarios.  Many design firms, municipal and campus planning agencies maintain 3D models of their territories and immediate context, but currently, it is rare to see these resources actually shared or systematically combined or preserved as cultural resources for for future reference.  In the case of public agencies, the problem is not a lack of will, but difficulties inherent in the combination of diverse data-sets that may be well-organized individually, but lack the forethought to be easily combined together in a re-useable way. 
    </p><p>
    Municipal and campus planning agencies have the mission and means to collect diverse 3D data -- including the current built scenario and information about development proposals.  While planning agencies may not be as interested as others in representing neighborhoods of the past, a good city model architecture, will make it simple for municipal and campus planning agencies to preserve information about the present -- which will become historical information as the city develops.
    </p><p>
    The goal of the citySchema project is to provide an open-source, interoperable city model architecture that addresses the needs of the municipal and campus planning agencies and designers, that saves municipalities the cost of designing their own city model architecture, and provides a framework for integrating these models together, for long-term archiving, and for re-use of a metropolitan-scale city model in virtual and augmented reality systems.   
    
    <h2>Municipal or Campus Planning Agency</h2> 
    The citySchema architecture was designed to meet the needs of the municipal GIS departments of the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts and the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA).  The BPDA's mission statement:
    <p style="margin: 20px">
      In partnership with communities, the BPDA plans Boston’s future while respecting its past. By guiding physical, social, and economic change in Boston’s neighborhoods, the BPDA seeks to shape a more prosperous, resilient and vibrant city for all.
    </p><p>
    Among the agencies responsibilities is to guide the public review of large development proposals and to lead the planning and development of for designated special planning areas.  This work involves much collection and two-way sharing of models for the purposes of visualization and as context for editable design models. In the future, 3D models will be part of the public record for development proposals, along with the digital two-dimensional models that are now included with proposals. 
    </p><p>
      The BPDA Urban Design group has been maintaining a city-wide 3D model since around 2003.  In 2014 the GIS department and pbcGIS began a project to develop a more detailed city-wide model that includes the building models developed by the UrbanDesign Technology Group.   The GIS-based model enables <a href="https://boston.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer3d/index.html?id=cf3415dea19d480caa71eb5dbdce185f" target="outboard">web-based visualizations of the city model </a>-- including projects that are approved but not yet built.  In-house applications,such as <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-urban/features/development-review" target = "arcdoc"> ArcGIS Urban</a>  make it possible for planners and reviewers to investigate scenarios that are not yet part of the public review process.  
    </p>
      <h3>Roles: Agency's Technical Curator</h3>
      <figure class="right">
        <img src="images/tall.jpg">
        <figcaption>Fig Right</figcaption>
      </figure>
     <p>
      The agencies 3D model curator develops the 3D model from GIS data and digital 3D models that originate in design software.  This role creates and re-uses programs that integrate 3D models with information resources including assessing information and content management systems associated with design review. The technical curator translates the GIS-based model into 3D models compatible with a variety of design-oriented 3D modeling tools and application development tool-chains. This role requires experience with 3D modeling and the issues that come up when working with 3D models in various formats.  The technical user also has an understanding of GIS, relational database fundamentals and basic programming using ArcGIS Model Builder. Programming with python and javascript is useful, as well.  The technical curator may be a full time staff member or a specialized contractor. 
    </p>      
        <h3>The Agency's Information Technology Manager</h3>
        The IT Manager is accountable for taking care of the agency's information assets.  This role involves hiring and evaluating the work of technical curator who may be employees or contractors.   For the IT manager, a successful 3D model architecture results in a collection of assets that is sustainable without dependencies on particular individuals holding the position of technical curator. For the IT manager, it will be useful to understand the essential pieces of the city model, where they are stored, and the sorts of problems that are likely to occur -- including the possibility that the digital assets associated with the city model may need to be migrated from one software platform to another.
      </p>
      <h3>
  
    <h2 id="oais">Standard-Based Archival Asset Management Approach</h2>
      3D models of building shells or terrain tiles are digital documents reflecting observations and ideas, very similar to scanned photographs and drawings.  In this sense, the architecture for developing, managing and sharing the city model has many of the functional characteristics of a digital asset management system for geographically and temporally referenced digital documents.   When these 3D models become systematically referenced and retrievable, they can be very useful for generating a 3D context for understanding the interrelationships connecting other documents. 
    </p>
    <p>The citySchema architecture is based on the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/57284.html" target="outboard">International Standards Organization Reference Model for Open Archival Information Systems. </a> 
    </p>

    <h3 id="fab">Features and Benefits </h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Save time and money in developing a city model curationprogram from scratch.
    <li>Preserve historical and source information.  Audit and recovery capabilities for all changes.  
    <li>Protect against loss of knowledge when data management staff move to other projects or jobs. 
    <li>Routine QC and validation of 3d models prevents unexpected roadblocks to exchange and migration.
    <li>Share and re-use city model assets in a variety of applications
    3D modeling tools
    <ul>
      <li>Archival asset management systems
      <li>Virtual and Augmented reality
      <li>Open source tool-chains and viewers (e.g. cesium)
      <li>High performance proprietary enterprise GIS.
      </ul>
    </ul>

    </p><p>
    As a bridge between the data-driven, expansive range of GIS, and the deeply hierarchal, but spatially limited world of 3D modeling tools, CitySchema substantially removes the difficulty of exchanging updates -- which can be published and subscribed between independent overlapping city models maintained at architecture firms, campus or municipal agencies, or developers of virtual and augmented reality applications.   
    </p><p>
      Communication between GIS and fully-functioning 3D modeling tools provides non-proprietary pathways for validation, quality control, and migration for an institution's collection of information assets.     
    </p><p>

    
    
    <h3 id="why">Expensive observations and effort are going to waste.</h3>
    <p>We know that in the Boston area there are several municipal governments, campus administrations and architecture firms that maintain broad-scale 3D models for their territorial interests and surrounding area. These models are used primarily for visualizing proposed changes. Many of these models overlap with each-other resulting in redundancy of details and of effort.  Opportunities to systematically remember the past form of the city is fragmented and impractical to collect -- even though millions of dollars are spent annually by different agencies to collect systematic snapshots of the city. 
    </p>

    Everyone agrees that ongoing collaboration in information stewardship is a good idea, but this does not seem to be a pattern that emerges spontaneously!   We do not see region-wide collaboration in the development and stewardship of city models because figuring out how to organize the work is very time-consuming. Individual participants don't have the motivation or skills think through the needs of collaborators from different disciplines with tools and workflows that pose real difficulties for information exchange. 
    </p><p>
      This project, sponsored in part by the <b>City of Boston Planning and Development Agency Office of Digital Cartography and GIS </b>  is designed to diminish these obstacles by working with contributors from the spectrum of disciplines to create a ready-made framework that is designed to preserve information about the shape of places in the city through all of the hand-offs that are required.
    </p>
    </p>
    <h3 id="streetscapes">Streetscapes are part of our Shared Cultural Heritage</h3> 
    <p>The world-wide web has brought about many new possibilities to access and connect information resources about people, places, things and ideas. Georeferencing is a powerful way of connecting resources that relate to places.  <a href="https://www.historypin.org/" target="outboard">HistoryPIN</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/map" target="outboard">Digital Commonwealth</a> and <a href="https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/" target="outboard">AtlasScope</a> are three examples of cultural preservation projects that use georeferencing to connect historical documents.  These are part of a greater movement known as Digital Humanities, in that is bringing about new ways of discovering,connecting and presenting ideas.

    <p>3D models of terrain and buildings are not much different from georeferenced photographs, drawings and maps.  It is only a matter of time before tools like the ones referenced above make use of 3D models as part of our cultural memory -- as observations that can be remembered and also as 3D base maps for contextualizing and connecting old photographs and other resources.  It is phenomenal how much new information emerges when observations from different points of view and points in time are connected together.
    </p>
   
    
    <h2>How? CitySchema is an Mode of Exchange and a Collection of Tools</h2>
    <p>The first product of the CitySchema project is our catalog repository for the City of Boston Planning and Development Agency.  It is ready to use now by the design and development community. Ready to be harvested by cultural preservation institutions.  A working demonstration of the repository schema  is published on GitHub to be forked and modified and by other agencies to organize and share their city model resources.
    </p><p>
    As the project moves forward in the second half of 2021, we wil be publishing the tools that develop and manage the model collections and their catalog.  Currently these tools are based on Python, ArcGIS Pro (tasks and geoprocessing tools), Javascript and HTML. 
    </p><p>As time moves on, we hope to engage with other interested parties to develop and share tools and workflows for using the metropolitan-scale city models with open-source workflows, including  ThreeJS, Blender and Cesium.

    <h2>Extending the Boston Metro City Model</h2>
    <p>Currently, we are finishing several substantial improvements to the architecture for managing and sharing city models sponsored by the Boston Planning and Development Agency. This new architecture will allow us to connect several other projects that wil link several other projects across the Boston metro area.
    <ul>
    <li><a href="./Metro3d_Slideshow_pbcGIS.pdf">Latest Metro3d Slideshow</a> documents the effort sponsored by the BPDA.
    
      <li>Treatment of 3d Models as historical assets within a collaborative archiving and annotation tool like <a href="https://chcomeka.azurewebsites.net/omeka-s/s/cdash/page/home">The Cambridge Digital Architectural Survey and History</a> (another pbcGIS project!)
      <li>Linking of a vast collection of detailed historic maps being compiled by the Norman Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library <a href="https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/#view:map">AtlasScope.</a>  We wil be tiling selected historical atlas maps for use in extending the Boston Metro 3D model back in time.
