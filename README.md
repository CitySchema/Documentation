## citySchema Documentation

This is the complete website that canbe viewd at www.citySchema.org .
It also provides the template for documentation that is provided with repositories.

If you want to use theis layour and template fror your own documentation, I recommend that you start by looking at the template/index.htm which provides a demonstration of all the styles. 

Repetitive blocks, including the index.  are managed with the resources/city_schema_includes.js

When new headings are added to pages or new pages added, you must update the index in resources/city_schema_includes.js
