  <h1 class="title">Contracting for 3D Buildng Models</h1>


<h2>3D City Modeling Request for Capabilities and Cost Estimates</h2>
<p>The BPDA has been maintaining a collection of 3D building and bridge models from various sources.  Our <a href="http://www.cityschema.org">model management tools and schema</a> makes it possible manage a collection of diverse 3d buildng models, incorporating updates and models of development proposals while preserving historical information.

<h3>Existng Model Collection to be Updated</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>  Wholesale LOD 2 models form a city-wide 2011 photogrammetric survey
  <li> Articulted LOD 3 models for specific planning areas created using the same 2011 survey
  <li>  Hand-made models representing large projects that have been proposed.  Many of these are now standing in for actual buildings that have been built.
  <li> Hand-made models of bridges.
  <li> Photogrammetrically-captured models of demolished buildings are preserved as a historical record. 
  </ul>

<h3>Ideal Specification for Updates</h3>
  <p>
  We are now hoping to update the model collection with 3D models of buildngs that have been built since 2011.
<ul>

<li>We are not planning to do a special fly-over for this project.  We are hoping to provide already-licensed stereo imagery with control and or LIDAR as needed.  If a 3D model provider had access to recent source data covering Boston, Massachusetts, this would be great. 

<li>We do not need to generate 3d models of every building in the city, but would consider this, if the quality of the new models is substantially improved over our existing models.

<li>We would be able to outline specific new buildings that need to be modeled, but if a vendor was able to discover changes that would be interesting.

<li>We hope to have models with true 3D roof details, and a decent representation of the sides of buildings.  

<li>We require efficient low-polygon models.  Preferably the model wil be jeneralized so that flat planes are represented with a minimum of triangles and with an angular tolerance that maintains right-angles and parallel features. 

<li>Textures are not necessary, but would be interesting to see what the extra charge would be for this.

<li>We recognize that it can be difficult to capture details near ground level. Ideally, the new models could be created with a below-ground margin to avoid floating corners that appear when different terrain models are used. 

<li>Extra consideration is given to modelers who are able to provide closed/water-tight models that perform as 3d solids in boolean operations. 

<li>We are interested in models that are free of use-restrictions.
  
<li>We prefer models to be deliverd in OBJ format, but may be able to use collada or multipatch.

<li>It would be useful to have an estimate that includes a set-up fee and a charge per building or square kilometer. 

</ul>

    <h3>Sources of Stereo Imagery with Control Info</h3>
<ul>  
  <li>MassGIS has spring 2021 aerials.  Jeff Amero says that he was able to get the stereo and control info for these. 
    <li>It may be possible to obtain and use NEarmap aerials and control for ths purpose.
